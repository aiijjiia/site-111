					“Choupette changed Karl’s life,” Amanda Harlech, Mr. Lagerfeld’s style consultant at Chanel, said.
					“He couldn’ t believe how happy she made him nor how she loved being by his side — even sleeping on his head! He
					would watch her for hours.”

					“I want people to be able to have something of their pet,” she said. “I get a lot of satisfac- tion out of it,
					knowing I can do something to make a memory for them.”

					“I get a little bit of healing out of each piece,” said Ms. Murphy, 41, whose parents died when she was young. “I
					do it selfishly because it makes me feel good, like I have a purpose.”

					“In my heart, Garlic is irreplaceable,” said Mr. Huang, who
					dug up his British shorthair and put the cat in his refrigerator in preparation for cloning him. “Garlic didn’t
					leave
					anything for future generations, so I could only choose to
					clone.”

					Recently, she did work for a man whose Pyrenees,
					Gryffindor, had just died.“Brushing and grooming your
					pet is an intimate ritual,” Ms. Furrer said. “What I’m able
					to do is a continuation of that ritual. If a pet has passed
					on, it closes that loop. The yarn becomes a part of their
					circle of life.”

					Soon enough, there were Instagram accounts dedicated to Choupette; glossy magazine spreads featuring Choupette
					(usually photographed by Mr. Lagerfeld); a makeup line by Shu Uemura called Shu-pette; a novelty book titled
					“Choupette: The Private Life of a High-Flying Fashion Cat”; and loads of other things. (In 2015 alone, she pulled
					in more than $3 million.)

					Roughly $35,000 and seven months later, Sinogene produced what China’s official news media declared to be the

					The size of China’s domestic pet market is expected to reach $28.2 billion this year, up nearly one-fifth from
					2018, according to Gouminwang, a pet consul- tancy in Beijing. The country already has 55 million pet dogs and 44
					million pet cats, and demand for cats is accelerating.

					Pet cloning is largely unregulated and controversial where it is done, but in China the barriers are especially
					low. Many Chinese people do not think that using animals for medical research or cosmetics testing is cruel, or
					that pet cloning is potentially problematic. There are also no laws against animal cruel- ty. Garlic is the first
					cat cloned by China, solidifying its position among major cloning nations, which include the United States,
					Britain and South Korea.
